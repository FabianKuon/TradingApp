# Stock trading support app

This app should help in the selection and trading of potential stocks.
It can be used to create standard KPIs, download stock price evolution
and retrieve the newest informations about a specific stock. 
Furthermore, it can be used as a recommender system (but without warranty)

Since this project is under construction, the features will be added once in a while.

Start the app with the command:
    docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yaml up --build
